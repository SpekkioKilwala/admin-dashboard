# admin-dashboard
Self-test/assignment for The Odin Project, focused on CSS.
There's obviously room for tweaking the appearance or exploring other style layouts, but
since this meets all the given requirements and I have more urgent things to study in other
areas (actual interactivity / JS) I'm declaring this done.

Maybe:
- A CSS reset and check for consistency across browsers
- Move colour information into variables to try out different palettes
- Adjust how the project-card resizing works? Something feels odd but I'm not sure what I want.
