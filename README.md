Self-test/assignment for The Odin Project, focused on CSS.

Stuff that still just needs to be done:
- adjusting the card layout for screen size
- The yellow side-stripe on the cards

Maybe:
- A CSS reset and check for consistency across browsers, but maybe just leave that for a later project
- Move colour information into variables to try out different palettes
