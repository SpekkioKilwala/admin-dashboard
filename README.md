Self-test/assignment for The Odin Project, focused on CSS.

Stuff that still just needs to be done:
- Header
    - Bell box
    - Welcome line
- Announcements
- Fonts
- Icons
- A CSS reset
- Move colour information into variables to try out different palettes

Backtrack points:
- Centering text on buttons
- Correct relative text size
- adjusting the card layout for screen size
- The yellow side-stripe on the cards
